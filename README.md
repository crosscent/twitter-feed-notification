# twitter-feed-notification

This project's purpose is to determine if a twitter event should be reported to the user.
The project has three separate sections:

* crawler.py
* streamer.py
* machine_learning.py

## crawler.py

Crawler goes through a given list of twitter handles, and retrieves the tweets
using ``@user_handle``.

## streamer.py

Stream contains two main classes:

* ``Streamer`` - this class streams the twitter API and diverts incoming tweets to another service
* ``OfflineStreamer`` - this class is a psuedo ``Streamer`` class that uses data from ``tweets.json``

## machine_learning.py

This file is central to the project. All tweets are preprocessed,
clustered by topics, and a notifier decides whether to send notification or
not.

### Preprocessing

All of the tweets in reply to another user is removed, and all retweets are
removed.

### Clustering

Two clustering methods are implemented: [NMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization) (Non-negative matrix Factorization) ,and [KMeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering).
Major benefit of KMeans is bagging is used until all "best tweets" from the largest
cluster converge into a single "tweet."

### Notifier

The notifier is a simply class that averages the amount of tweet.
If there are 3 times more tweets than the average tweet amount,
notify the user.

An improved notifier class would check the time and day. My assumption is there are
less tweets at night and on weekends.

## Setup

Please create a file ``setup.py`` containing the following information

```
twitter_consumer_key = ""
twitter_consumer_secret = ""
twitter_access_token = "-pSQ6R6ZolM3XfRofCMmgIyLy0XPY5UStjC5SMAY2Hy"
twitter_access_secret = ""
feeds = ['nytimes', 'thesunnewspaper', 'thetimes', 'ap', 'cnn', 'bbcnews',
         'cnet', 'msnuk', 'telegraph', 'usatoday', 'wsj', 'washingtonpost',
         'bostonglobe', 'newscomauhq', 'skynews', 'sfgate', 'ajenglish',
         'independent', 'guardian', 'latimes', 'reutersagency', 'abc',
         'bloombernews', 'bw', 'time']
